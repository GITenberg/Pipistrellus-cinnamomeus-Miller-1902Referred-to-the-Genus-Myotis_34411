<h2>Pipistrellus cinnamomeus Miller 1902<br /> Referred to the Genus Myotis</h2>

<h4>By</h4>

<h3>E. RAYMOND HALL AND WALTER W. DALQUEST</h3>


<p>Miller (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, 1902, p. 390, September
3,1902) based the name <i>Pipistrellus cinnamomeus</i> on a skin and skull of
a vespertilionid bat obtained on May 4, 1900, at Montecristo, Tabasco,
Mexico, by E. W. Nelson and E. A. Goldman. A single specimen was
available to Miller when he proposed the name <i>P. cinnamomeus</i>. Dalquest
and Hall (Jour. Mamm., 29:180, May 14, 1948) reported three additional
specimens collected in 1946 by W. W. Dalquest on the R&iacute;o Blanco, twenty
kilometers west-northwest of Piedras Negras, Veracruz, Mexico. No other
published information concerning this species is known to us, although
the name has, of course, appeared in regional lists, for example in the
"List of North American Recent Mammals, 1923" (Bull. U. S. National
Museum, 128:75, April 29, 1924) by Gerrit S. Miller, Jr.</p>

<p>Additional specimens, nevertheless, are known. Two collected on April 18
and 20, 1903, at Papayo, Guerrero, by Nelson and Goldman, are in the
Biological Surveys Collection in the United States National Museum. A
skin, probably of this species, for which the skull cannot now be found,
was taken on October 27, 1904, at Esquinapa, Sinaloa, by J. H. Batty and
is in the American Museum of Natural History. This is the skin referred
by Miller and Allen (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 144:100, May 25, 1928) to
<i>Myotis occultus</i>. Three additional specimens, each a skin with skull,
were collected twenty kilometers east-northeast of Jes&uacute;s Carranza, at
200 feet elevation, Veracruz, by Walter W. Dalquest, two on April 13,
1949, and one on May 16 of the same year. These are in the Museum of
Natural History of the University of Kansas, as also are the three
previously reported by Dalquest and Hall (<i>loc. cit.</i>). A total of ten
specimens, from five localities, all in Mexico, thus is accounted for.</p>

<p>On page 392 of the original description&mdash;which our study of the holotype
shows to be accurate&mdash;Miller wrote: "This bat differs so widely from the
other known American species of <i>Pipistrellus</i> as to need no special
comparisons. Superficially it has much the appearance of an unusually
red <i>Myotis lucifugus</i>, and only on examination of the teeth do the
animal's true relationships become apparent."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span> In referring to the teeth
Miller almost certainly was thinking of the premolars of which there are
only two on each side of the upper jaw and on each side of the lower jaw
in <i>Pipistrellus</i>, including his <i>Pipistrellus cinnamomeus</i>, whereas
<i>Myotis</i> at that time was thought always to have three premolars on each
side of both the upper and lower jaw, except in rare instances where one
premolar might be lacking on one side of one jaw or even more rarely on
both sides of the upper jaw. In his original description of <i>P.
cinnamomeus</i>, Miller mentioned also that it had the "Inner upper incisor
distinctly smaller than the outer, not approximately equal to it as is
the case in <i>P. subflavus</i>."</p>

<p>At this point it is well to make clear that each of the genera
<i>Pipistrellus</i> and <i>Myotis</i> contains a large number of species and that
the differences between the two genera are few. Our examination of
American specimens reveals only one differential character: In <i>Myotis</i>
the outer upper incisor is distinctly larger than the inner, whereas the
two incisors are of approximately equal size in <i>Pipistrellus</i>. It may
be noted that the outer upper incisor of several, but not all, species
of <i>Myotis</i> has a well-developed concave surface directed toward the
canine whereas this surface is flat or convex in <i>Pipistrellus</i>. In both
features, the type of <i>Pipistrellus cinnamomeus</i> Miller agrees with
<i>Myotis</i> and differs from <i>Pipistrellus</i>.</p>

<p>Five years after naming and describing <i>Pipistrellus cinnamomeus</i>,
Miller published his monumental work entitled "The families and genera
of bats" (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 57, June 29, 1907) wherein he points
out the differences in the upper incisors between <i>Pipistrellus</i> and
<i>Myotis</i> (by a <i>lapsus plumae</i> ascribes subequal incisors to <i>Myotis</i>
and unequal incisors to <i>Pipistrellus</i>) but seemingly failed to
re&euml;xamine <i>P. cinnamomeus</i> in the light of this better understanding of
the two genera, or if he did examine <i>P. cinnamomeus</i> he possibly was
misled still by the absence of the third premolar on each side of both
the upper and lower jaw.</p>

<p>In 1928 when Miller and Allen published their account of "The American
bats of the Genera <i>Myotis</i> and <i>Pizonyx</i>" (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 144,
May 25, 1928) they examined specimens of <i>Myotis occultus</i> which they
implied (<i>op. cit.</i>: 99-100) had only two instead of three premolars on
each side of both the upper and lower jaws. In preparing this taxonomic
account of bats of the genus <i>Myotis</i>, the specimens (type and two from
Papayo) of <i>Pipistrellus cinnamomeus</i> seem not to have been examined.
Indeed, it is almost certain that they were not examined for the species
was renamed; the new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span> name, <i>Myotis lucifugus fortidens</i> Miller and
Allen (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 144:54, May 25, 1928), was based on a
skull with the corresponding body in alcohol. The characters of this
specimen are almost exactly those of <i>Pipistrellus cinnamomeus</i>, named
and described by Miller 26 years earlier. The type locality (Teapa) of
<i>M. l. fortidens</i> is 80 miles westerly from the type locality of <i>P.
cinnamomeus</i>; both are in the state of Tabasco, and in the same
life-zone, at equivalent elevations (neither higher than 50 meters).
Since there are no characters of taxonomic worth to distinguish the two
named specimens, <i>Myotis lucifugus fortidens</i> Miller and Allen 1928
falls as a synonym of <i>Pipistrellus cinnamomeus</i> Miller 1902. But,
according to Miller and Allen (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 144:19, 197),
<i>Vespertilio cinnamomeus</i> Wagner 1855 is a name based on <i>Myotis ruber</i>
(E. Geoffroy, 1806) from Paraguay and hence <i>Myotis cinnamomeus</i>
(Miller) 1902 is a homonym of <i>Myotis cinnamomeus</i> (Wagner) 1855 and is
unavailable for the animal from Montecristo when it is transferred to
the genus <i>Myotis</i>; the species of animal concerned will take the next
available name, which seems to be <i>Myotis lucifugus fortidens</i> Miller
and Allen 1928.</p>

<p>It may reasonably be asked if <i>Myotis</i> and <i>Pipistrellus</i> should be
retained as separate genera if the only constant difference between the
two is subequal versus unequal upper incisors. In our opinion it would
be worth-while for someone who had access to adequate material from both
the Old World and the New World to investigate this question. We lack
adequate material from the Old World.</p>

<p>When Miller and Allen named <i>M. l. fortidens</i> they had only two
specimens, the holotype from Teapa, Tabasco, and a referred specimen
from Fort Hancock, El Paso County, Texas, approximately 1,200 miles
north-northwest of Teapa. We have examined this specimen from Texas (U.
S. Nat. Mus., 21083/36121, skin and skull) and regard it as <i>Myotis
lucifugus carissima</i> Thomas. Furthermore, we regard the holotype of
<i>Myotis lucifugus fortidens</i> Miller and Allen 1928 as specifically
distinct from <i>Myotis lucifugus</i> of Miller and Allen 1928. The Cinnamon
Myotis, described below, therefore may stand as:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Myotis fortidens</i> is known only from the Tropical
Life-zone. The skin, without a skull, from Esquinapa, Sinaloa, agrees in
color with the undoubted specimens of <i>M. fortidens</i> from Papayo,
Guerrero, but can be matched also by selected skins of <i>Myotis occultus</i>
from Blythe, Riverside County, California. Without the skull the
reference of this specimen to <i>M. fortidens</i> is provisional. Reason for
referring it to <i>fortidens</i> rather than to <i>M. occultus</i> is provided,
however, by a series of eleven specimens of <i>M. occultus</i> from &Aacute;lamos,
Sonora. These are Saccardo's Umber rather than Cinnamon-Brown and they
are geographically intermediate between the reddish <i>M. occultus</i> of
California and the reddish <i>M. fortidens</i> of Mexico. Furthermore, these
specimens from &Aacute;lamos have large skulls of slightly different
proportions than those of <i>M. fortidens</i> or than those of <i>M. occultus</i>
from California; possibly the animals from &Aacute;lamos are representative of
the larger, duller-colored variation for which Hollister proposed the
name <i>Myotis baileyi</i> (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 22:44, March 10,
1909). This duller-colored type of animal intervenes between the
geographic ranges of undoubted <i>M. occultus</i> and undoubted <i>M.
fortidens</i>. The specimen from Esquinapa, in the geographic sense, is on
the <i>fortidens</i> side rather than on the <i>occultus</i> side of the <i>baileyi</i>
population. This geographic position is the basis on which the specimen
from Esquinapa is referred to <i>M. fortidens</i>. The third premolar is
lacking from each side of both the upper and the lower jaws of each
individual of this series from &Aacute;lamos.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span></p>

<p>The specimens of <i>M. fortidens</i> are all distinguishable by their color
from other kinds of <i>Myotis</i> found in the same area. Occasional
individuals of <i>Myotis velifer</i>, as for example three from Las Vigas,
Veracruz, also are reddish but they are of brighter tone. In addition,
the larger size and cranial features of these specimens of <i>M. velifer</i>
permit ready differentiation of them from specimens of <i>M. fortidens</i>.
One specimen (No. 32113) of <i>M. fortidens</i> from twenty kilometers
east-northeast of Jes&uacute;s Carranza is lighter than the others, being near
(<i>j</i>) Cinnamon-Brown above and is lighter on the under-parts than on the
upper parts. Another individual (No. 32112) is duller colored than the
others, being Snuff Brown both above and below. Otherwise the specimens
of <i>M. fortidens</i> agree in color.</p>

<p>Among named kinds of <i>Myotis</i>, <i>M. fortidens</i> resembles <i>Myotis
lucifugus</i> and <i>Myotis occultus</i>. From the former, <i>M. fortidens</i>
differs in possessing a strong sagittal crest and in lacking the third
premolar in both the upper jaw and the lower jaw. <i>M. fortidens</i> lacks
the glossy sheen found on the pelage of many individuals of <i>M.
lucifugus</i>. From <i>M. occultus</i>, <i>M. fortidens</i> differs in having the
rostrum (viewed from above) smaller in relation to the braincase. This
is true of specimens with the teeth showing much wear as well as in
specimens with the teeth unworn or only moderately worn. Also, <i>M.
fortidens</i> is longer bodied as may be seen by comparing the measurements
given here with those recorded for <i>M. occultus</i> by Miller and Allen
(Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 144:100, May 25, 1928). We are agreed that <i>M.
fortidens</i> is as closely related to <i>M. occultus</i> as to any other named
kind of <i>Myotis</i>, and that it is more closely related to it than to most
other species of the genus, but one of us (Dalquest) thinks that <i>M.
fortidens</i> is specifically distinct from <i>M. occultus</i>, whereas the
other author (Hall) inclines to the view that additional specimens from
localities intermediate between the known geographic ranges of <i>M.
occultus</i> and <i>M. fortidens</i> will reveal intergradation between the two
kinds. However that may be, there is no proof at present of such
intergradation and the binomial is therefore used for the Cinnamon
Myotis.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
